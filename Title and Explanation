📘 Explanation of the Student Records Management System – Track, Edit, and Organize with Ease
🎯 Program Purpose

This program is an interactive Student Management System written in Python.
It allows the user to:

Add new students

Edit existing student information

Delete students

Display students sorted by name or grade

Search for a student using binary search

Exit the application

Students are stored in memory as dictionaries inside a list.

Example student record:

{'id': '123', 'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 'A'}


The program uses a menu-driven interface and lets the user perform operations repeatedly.

🧩 Detailed Explanation of Each Component
1️⃣ Global Student List
students_TLS = []


This list stores all student records.
Each student is represented as a dictionary with keys "id", "name", and "grade".

2️⃣ bubble_sort(students_TLS, key)
Purpose

Sorts the given list of students by a chosen key:

"name"

"grade"

How it works

This function implements the Bubble Sort algorithm:

It compares each pair of adjacent students

If they are out of order, it swaps them

Repeats until the list is sorted

Although not the most efficient, it works well for small lists.

3️⃣ binary_search(students_TLS, student_id)
Purpose

Searches for a student by ID.

How it works

The function assumes that the list is already sorted by ID.

It uses binary search, which:

Looks at the middle of the list

Compares the ID there with the target

Eliminates half of the list each step

Returns:

Index if found

-1 if not found

4️⃣ add_student()
What it does

Prompts the user for:

Student ID

Name

Grade

Checks if the ID already exists (to prevent duplicates)

Adds the student to the global list

Automatically displays the updated list sorted by name

5️⃣ edit_student()
What it does

Asks the user which ID they want to edit

Sorts a copy of the list by ID

Searches using binary search

If found:

Allows the user to change the name and/or grade

Leaving a field blank keeps the original value

Displays the updated list

6️⃣ delete_student()
What it does

Prompts the user for an ID to delete

Finds the student

Asks the user if they want to edit before deleting

Confirms deletion before removing the student

Displays the updated list after deletion

If the last student is deleted, it informs the user that the list is empty.

7️⃣ display_students(auto=False)
Purpose

Shows the list of students in a clean, formatted table.

Two modes:

Manual mode (auto=False)

Asks the user whether to sort by:

1 → name

2 → grade

Automatic mode (auto=True)

Automatically sorts by name (used after adding/editing/deleting)

Uses bubble sort to sort the list.

8️⃣ search_student()
Purpose

Find a student by ID using binary search.

How it works

Sorts the student list by ID

Runs binary search

Displays the found student or a "not found" message

9️⃣ menu()
Purpose

Acts as the main user interface.

How it works

Displays options in an infinite loop

Waits for user input

Calls the corresponding function:

Add

Edit

Delete

Display

Search

Exit program

sys.exit() is used to stop the program cleanly.

🔚 Main Entry Point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    menu()


This ensures the menu runs only when the file is executed directly.
